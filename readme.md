# OEM Unleashed
The UnleashedX dashboard that adhears to the official design language. 

## Why?
After many years, we decided to uncover our old Xbox that was running UnleashedX. We felt as though none of the skins really captured the true feel of the stock Xbox homescreen, which was nostalgic for us. We decided to create our own, to give us as close of a feel as possible.


## Credits
- Rapitharian for most of the dashboard's Skin file.
- Frontesque for the dashboard's custom assets.
- This skin uses "TrueMSdash" 1.0 by PeterPL as a base.
